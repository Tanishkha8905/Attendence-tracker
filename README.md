# Attendence-tracker This Kivy Attendance App is designed to help teachers or users take and manage student attendance easily. It allows the user to input a roll number range, select a subject, and choose a date from a 30-day range (past and future). Upon clicking the "Start Attendance" button, a dynamic list of checkboxes appears, one for each roll number, where the user can mark students as present or absent. When the "Save Attendance" button is clicked, the data is stored in a CSV file specific to the selected subject. The program ensures that existing data is updated correctly, new dates are appended, and attendance percentages are calculated for each student. It handles missing entries by marking them as absent and maintains consistency across all entries. Additionally, it displays a popup summary of who was present and absent on the selected date, and uses popups for error handling and validation, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
